# Comprehensive LLM Training

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive training pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs), covering pretraining, instruction tuning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and human alignment fine-tuning using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The pipeline integrates state-of-the-art optimization techniques to enhance training efficiency and model performance.

## Features
- **Pretraining & Fine-tuning**: Supports instruction tuning via SFT and human alignment fine-tuning with DPO.
- **Memory Optimization**: Utilizes DeepSpeed ZeRO 3, PEFT LoRA, and Flash Attention 2 to optimize memory usage and speed up multi-GPU training.
- **Diverse Task Training**: Incorporates a wide range of real-world scenarios to improve LLM robustness and usability.
- **Multi-GPU Efficiency**: Leverages advanced techniques to scale efficiently across multiple GPUs.
